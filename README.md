# New_Algorithm
## Like a SOM (Self-Organizing-Map)

1. Hidden node means a map of 10*10
2. Weight values on hidden nodes represent the strength of the data
3. Hidden layers consists of three layers 
4. Each layer interacts with each other and updates the weight value
5. Finally, Weight values can be obtained for three layers
6. 

# Algorithm1
## Create maps through integration of each dimension

1. The rows in the map are determined by the number of hidden nodes
2. The columns in the map are determined by the number of dimensions

# Alorithm 2
## Create a map in one dimension
## One dimension per data

1. The rows and columns in the map are determined by the number of hidden nodes
2. Each data is dimensionally separated, each dimension has a map
